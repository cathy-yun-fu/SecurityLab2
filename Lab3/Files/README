Generate QR code:
Common:
We hard code the value for the string counter=1 for HOTP and period=30 for TOTP. When secrete key is passed in, we convert the secret key into base 2 (convert the character into an integer and shift bits). We then pass our secret key into the function base32_encode to get the encoded_key. After that, we can get the QR code by conbining secret key with counter for HOTP or period for TOTP.

Validate QR code:

We first initialize HMAC to XOR the secret key with ipad and opad according to the HMAC procedure. To compute HOTP HMAC, we make the counter value into a 8 byte array and pass into given sha1 function. We compare the sha output with dynamic truncate value. If the values are the same, we return true for saying this HOTP is valid, and false for otherwise.

For TOTP is the same process. The only difference is that instead of counter, we divide our current time with period 30 ( timer = time(null) / 30). After getting the timer value, we put it into a 8 byte array and pass into given sha1 function. We compare the sha output with dynamic truncate value. If the values are the same, we return true for saying this TOTP is valid, and false for otherwise.
